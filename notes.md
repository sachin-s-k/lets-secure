## 2. Authentication & Authorization

- [ ] Secure Authentication (e.g., MFA, rate limiting)
- [ ] Role-Based or Attribute-Based Access Control
- [ ] Secure Session Management
- [ ] Strong Password Hashing (bcrypt/scrypt/argon2)

- [ ] Secure Cookie Flags (`Secure`, `HttpOnly`, `SameSite`)

## 5. Client-Side Security

- [ ] Use Content Security Policy (CSP)
- [ ] Set Security Headers (e.g., `X-Content-Type-Options`)
- [ ] Prevent Clickjacking with `X-Frame-Options` or `frame-ancestors`
- [ ] Use Subresource Integrity (SRI)
- [ ] Avoid storing sensitive data in localStorage/sessionStorage
- [ ] Sanitize DOM inputs (e.g., with DOMPurify)

## 6. Cross-Origin Protections
